eXtensible Neural Machine Translation
=====================================

This is a stub of a repository to create an extensible neural machine translation toolkit.
It is coded in Python based on [DyNet](http://github.com/clab/dynet).

Coding Style
------------

In general, follow Python conventions. Must be Python3 compatible. Functions should be snake case.

Indentation should be two whitespace characters.

Aim to write unit tests for most functionality where possible.
